{{ project.title }} is a tool for artists and creative technologists which automates the creation, management, and syndication of art and personal projects across various channels. As I started to create more art, the toil of managing and organizing my work across different platforms became annoying, so I decided to create a tool to streamline it all.

{{ project.title }} does the following through a simple CLI:
- Creates local project directories to store work-in-progress files and media, 
- Sets up a GitHub repository for your project
- Optionally, creates a Things 3 project
...all with consistent organization and metadata.

Once ready, {{ project.title }} also facilitates syndication of project content through various channels:
- A portfolio website (designed for websites powered by Jekyll)
- Github
- PDF summaries for submission to open call and exhibitions

Almost all of the content on my website is managed using {{ project.title }}.
